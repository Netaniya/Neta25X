# Neta25X

Emotionally intelligent AI companion with real-time interaction, personalization, and expressive visual identity.

This repository contains the initial web interface skeleton for Neta25X.

## Structure

- `assets/images` – visual identity assets (logo, character images)
- `styles` – custom CSS and design tweaks
- `scripts` – client-side behavior and interactions
- `index.html` – entry point for the interface

The page uses TailwindCSS and the Orbitron font to convey a futuristic, poetic atmosphere.

## Git LFS
This project uses [Git Large File Storage](https://git-lfs.github.com/) to manage binary assets like images. To contribute, install Git LFS and run `git lfs install` after cloning the repository.
